I'm a curious mind navigating the vast void of code, systems, and networks.
I go by the alias 0xVoidLoop — a symbol of endless exploration and the infinite recursion of curiosity.

I have a deep interest in:

🖥️ Linux

🌐 Networking & DevOps

🧠 Firmware Tinkering

🔧 Self-hosting, Automation

I spend my time breaking things to understand them better — tinkering with Linux-based systems, experimenting with servers, and contributing to the open-source ecosystem whenever I can. My environment is mostly CLI, my tools are minimal, and my philosophy is simple:
Build things. Understand them. Share the knowledge.

```I live in the terminal, but I dream in binaries.```
