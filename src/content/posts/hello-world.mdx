Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Prajwal â€” a curious and creative mind exploring the worlds of technology, coding, gaming, and entrepreneurship. Iâ€™m currently a diploma student in Computer Engineering, but my ambitions go far beyond the classroom walls.

## ðŸ’» Why I Started This Blog
This blog is more than just a portfolio. Itâ€™s my digital playground â€” a space where Iâ€™ll document my projects, ideas, wins, failures, and everything I learn along the way.
Whether Iâ€™m building a web app, experimenting with Linux, or trying to make passive income online â€” I want to share it all.

I believe growth becomes 10x more powerful when you track your journey and share it with others. Thatâ€™s what this blog is all about.

## ðŸ“Œ What You Can Expect
Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll mostly find here:

- Project Breakdowns â€“ Case studies of apps and tools I build (like AgroConnect, Debug Bull, etc.)

- Tech Experiments â€“ Exploring Linux distros, servers, AI tools, game dev, and more

- Hustle Diaries â€“ My attempts at freelancing, blogging, online income, and business ideas

- Life & Motivation â€“ Thoughts on focus, productivity, growth, and mindset

## ðŸŒ± My Vision
I want to become a versatile tech creator â€” someone who can build, design, solve, and lead.
From coding my own platforms to launching side hustles to possibly working abroad â€” my dream is to live a high-impact, creative, and independent life.
This blog is my step toward that.

## ðŸ™Œ Letâ€™s Connect
Thanks for stopping by! If you're also someone chasing skills, success, and self-growth â€” you're in the right place.
Feel free to explore, drop a comment, or connect with me on Discord/Twitter/LinkedIn.

### Letâ€™s build something awesome. Together.
â€“ Prajwal
