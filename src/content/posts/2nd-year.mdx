If the 1st year was fun, the 2nd year of my Computer Engineering diploma was like getting hit by a semicolon storm in a C++ codebase. Between never-ending assignments, microprojects, and internals that felt more like drama than academics, it was tough balancing studies and my personal tech side projects.

## 📚 The Assignment Apocalypse
Let’s just take a moment to appreciate how every subject suddenly came with:

- Assignments (written!)
- Microprojects
- And the classic: “Submit kar dena warna marks kat jaenge.”

Honestly, I was spending more time writing than typing code.

## 🧠 Semester 3: The Real Start of Tech Learning
This semester tried to build our foundations stronger (and stress levels even stronger-er):

- OOPs in C++: Objects, Classes, Inheritance—finally, programming started to feel like actual engineering.

- Data Structures (in C): We dipped into sorting & searching algorithms. It was cool learning how a computer "thinks" while handling data.

- Computer Graphics (Theory): The irony? We didn't touch any graphics. Just studied algorithms to draw a line on screen. Yay.

- Database Management Systems (DBMS): Learned SQL, PL/SQL, all the DML, DDL, DQL stuff. This one actually felt useful.

- Digital Techniques: THE BOSS LEVEL. Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal, Flip-Flops, Counters, Registers. Basically, the part of the CPU that screams in binary. It was painful… but unforgettable.

## 🔥 Semester 4: Getting Real With Programming
This was the "tech-packed" sem that brought in more brain load—and some fun too:

- Java Programming: Object-Oriented again but now with curly braces and JavaBeans.

- Software Engineering: Learned about SDLC, Agile, Waterfall—basically, how to plan software before coding like maniacs.

- Data Communication: Our first taste of Networking—what happens behind the scenes of Wi-Fi and the Internet. Packets, protocols, and ping madness.

- Microprocessors: Another beast. Focused on 8086, Assembly Language, memory segmentation… it was hardcore and kinda confusing.

- GUI App Development: This was the fun bit—making windows, buttons, input boxes with code! But honestly, I barely remember how to do it now. 😅

## 🧾 Summary
My 2nd year was like juggling hot potatoes—trying to manage:

- Tech concepts

- Dozens of assignments

- Microprojects

- My own side coding experiments

But despite all the mental gymnastics, I learned a lot. From object-oriented programming to databases, and even network basics, the technical depth grew fast. It was chaotic, challenging, and kind of beautiful in a nerdy way.

### Rating? A strong 8.5/10.
(Just deducting 1.5 for the trauma caused by written assignments and Digital Techniques.)
