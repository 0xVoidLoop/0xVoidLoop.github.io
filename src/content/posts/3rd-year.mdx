And here it is… the final chapter of my 3-year Diploma in Computer Engineering. 

Was it thrilling? Yes. 

Chaotic? Definitely. 

Productive? Hmm... 

let’s just say, I survived. Third year felt like that final boss level — full of twists, some unexpected plot points, a few side quests (a.k.a internships), and one main mission: complete the damn diploma!

## 🧠 Semester 5: Things Got Real (Kind of…)
### 📂 Operating Systems
Finally met the OG of computers — the Operating System. From Linux basics to schedulers, preemption, and other low-level black magic. I can now proudly cd, ls, and sudo like a hacker (almost 😎).
### ☕ Advanced Java Programming
AWT and Swing? Why are we still stuck in the early 2000s? We learned about building UIs the old-school way, event handling, Java networking, CRUD ops with databases, and finally Servlets. Good learning, but man, we need an upgrade!
### 🧪 Software Testing
Black-box, white-box, grey-box — no, I’m not talking about Tupperware.
We learned how to write test cases, tools, and the philosophies of why testing matters (even though I still write code that’s “tested in production” 💀).
### 🌐 Advanced Computer Networks
IPV6, transport/application layer protocols, multicast vs unicast — basically all the stuff that happens in the background while you stream Netflix. Complex, but informative.
### 💼 Industrial Training
Internship time! I chose Web Dev and did 6 weeks at Prodigy Infotech and InternPe. Mostly basic stuff: HTML, CSS, JS. But it gave me a working idea of how websites are built, hosted, and… crash 😅.
### 📈 Capstone Project Planning
Here’s where things got exciting. I, with my team of 5, planned AgroConnect — a full entrepreneurial tech project combining agriculture + software. A proud moment in the making...

## 🐍 Semester 6: The Final Boss
### 🐍 Python Programming
The semester began with Python. It was fun to learn loops, functions, lists, and later DSA with stacks, queues, dictionaries, etc. Honestly, Python felt like a breath of fresh air after Java.

### 📱 Mobile App Dev (MAD)
Ironic name, because the situation was mad. We were taught Android using Java, but the labs couldn’t handle Android Studio. No practicals, no exposure — just theory. Big letdown.

### 💻 Emerging Trends in IT
A subject so “emerging” that it had zero depth. Just MCQs and generic knowledge. Thanks for nothing.

### 🔐 Network & Info Security
This was interesting! We explored encryption methods, Caesar cipher, steganography, firewalls, DMZ, IDS, cyber laws, and even IT Acts. Real-world applicable stuff.

### 📊 Management
Uh... why? No one really cared, and I’m still unsure what I was supposed to “manage.” Maybe my patience?

### 🚀 Capstone Execution & Report
The grand finale — AgroConnect in full action.
Using React, Tailwind, and Flask, we built and deployed a project that actually impressed people at competitions. We won! 🎉
Sadly, the internals hit like a truck. No prep + broken viva sessions = low scores. Welcome to Indian education, where mugging > building.

### 💬 The Harsh Reality
Despite my love for tech, creativity, and side projects, internal marks weren’t in my favor.
While some students mugged up PDFs and scored full marks, people like me who focused on building, coding, and learning practically got ignored.

This messed up my CGPA and might hinder my B.Tech lateral entry due to high cutoffs. But hey, we move forward. This is India — skills are valued in the industry, not in internal vivas.

## 💭 Final Thoughts: Rating the Rollercoaster
My third year was:

#### 📚 Technical as hell

#### 🎉 Full of learnings, side projects, and some wins

#### 💥 Drama with teachers, friends, and assessments

#### 😩 Emotionally draining at times

#### 🧠 Growth-focused and unforgettable

#### Rating: 7/10 – It wasn’t perfect, but it made me who I am.

This marks the end of my journey at Ajeenkya DY Patil College, and the beginning of something bigger. Now it's time to level up!

## 🔜 What’s Next?
Well, I’ve got 2 months free, and the grind begins:

- Mastering C & Python

- Learning DSA deeply

- UI/UX in Figma

- Web/App Dev Projects

- OSSU journey

> All documented on GitHub 💻

### Stay tuned. The next blog will be about my post-diploma transformation.
