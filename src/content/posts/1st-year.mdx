Starting my diploma journey in Computer Engineering at Ajeenkya DY Patil College was a mix of excitement, confusion, and a lot of "what even is this subject?" vibes.

The first year mostly felt like an extension of schoolâ€”Physics, Chemistry, and Maths made a comeback. Honestly, these subjects felt kind of useless in the context of actual college-level tech learning. We all knew we werenâ€™t going to calculate chemical reactions in code.

Things got a little more interesting when we were introduced to C programming. Writing loops, playing with functionsâ€”it was my first real taste of coding, and I started to feel what Computer Engineering might actually be about.

Then came Engineering Drawing. Letâ€™s just sayâ€¦ it existed. Drawing nuts, bolts, and weird 3D objects on paper didnâ€™t really feel connected to software or coding. Not my thing.

We also had Basic Electronics, where we learned about components like resistors, diodes, transistors, and logic gates. It was cool to understand how circuits work, even if I was more into writing code than building circuits.

One of the highlights of the year was Web Page Designing. We learned to create basic web pages using HTML and CSS, and touched just a bit of JavaScript. That part felt modern and relevantâ€”and made me want to dive deeper into web development.

Overall, my first year was fun, despite the mix of subjects. Some of them felt disconnected from the real world of tech, but the exposure was valuable. Iâ€™d give it a 7/10. Solid start.
